# Outdoor sensor modules

The indoor sensor modules will also be powered by the [Particle
Photon](https://store.particle.io/?product=particle-photon) module. Photons are
USB powered and have an integrated ARM microcontroller and wifi module. The
device will use the Particle Pub/Sub API to send new data to the aggregator
module.

The outdoor sensor modules will use the [AM2315 - Encased I2C
Temperature/Humidity Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1293). The
outdoor module will also contain the [BMP180 Barometric
Pressure/Temperature/Altitude Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1603)

# Indoor sensor modules

The indoor sensor modules will be powered by the [Particle
Photon](https://particle.io/) module. Photons are USB powered and have an
integrated ARM microcontroller and wifi module. This will make it easy to
connect implement a web server that can be polled by the Raspberry Pi.

The indoor sensor modules will use the [AM2302 temperature & humidity
sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/393) and use a enclosure.

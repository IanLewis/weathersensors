# Indoor sensor modules

The indoor sensor modules will be powered by the [Particle
Photon](https://particle.io/) module. Photons are USB powered and have an
integrated ARM microcontroller and wifi module. The device will use the
Particle Pub/Sub API to send new data to the aggregator module.

The indoor sensor modules will use the [AM2302 temperature & humidity
sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/393) and use a enclosure.
